# PID-Optimization-by-Evolutionary-Algorithms
This repo provides three optimization algorithms(Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Estimation of Distribution (EDA)) for optimization of PID coeficients for a linear transfer function. You should run  GA_Opt_PID.m, PSO_Opt_PID.m and EDA_Opt_PID.m in three different folders.
